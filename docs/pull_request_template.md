### What does this PR do?
pretty much just say oh it helps a user do this and this

### Why are you doing this?
again, just go over how it relates to the project and how the user benefits from it

### Where should a reviewer start?
this is just a spot that you can say hey this function I implemented is in the main.js file, or the HTML I added is in my index.html file, just so a reviewer knows where to look
