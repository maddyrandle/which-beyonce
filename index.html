        <p class="instruction">The goal of the game is to find all 5 pairs of cards as quickly as possible. The player that finds the greatest numbers of pairs, wins.</p>
        <p class="instruction">To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of Beyoncé. Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will have completed a match! If they don’t, you’ll have three seconds to look at them before they flip back over. Then it’s time for the other player to try!</p>
        <p class="instruction">After you play, you’ll see the name of the final winner and how long it took to win the game.</p>
